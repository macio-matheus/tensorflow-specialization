Best practices for TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework to train a neural network for a computer vision applications.

Handle real-world image data and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout.

Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.

Apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs as you train them using text repositories.

### Modules
```sh
 - Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning 
 - Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
 - Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
 - Sequences, Time Series and Prediction
```

### Usage
First of all, build the container using docker-compose and then you can 
access the Jupyter that is ready to be used.

#### Run with docker compose
```sh
cd neural-networks-deep-learning
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Accessing Jupyter
```sh
http://<your-ip>:8888/tree
```
